# Machine_learning_deep_learning_portofolio

#### 1. In this code i try to compare several models to find the best model in Supervised Learning for my dataset. Models i compared is Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and Support Vector Machine. Based on test i carried out, the best model that fits in my datasets is gradient boosting.
#### 2. In this code i try to do data segmentation with clusterring method.
#### 3. In this code i try to design and create simple neural network. Datasets i used is MNIST handwritten digit datasets.
